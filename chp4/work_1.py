# Your goal is to draw a black rectangle positioned in the middle of the canvas. Its height is equal to the height of the canvas. The rectangleâ€™s width instead changes according to a variable "factor" between 0 and 1:

# if 0, the rectangle's width is equal to 0
# if 1, the rectangle's width is equal to the canvas width
